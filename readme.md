# 3Js Workshop

## In order to get this to work, follow these steps :)

**All dependencies should be installed already with the JSON files and Vite configuration. Go to Step 1; if Step 1 isn't working, skip to Step 2. Otherwise, enjoy!**

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Apple only; add Homebrew to your shell.

echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Linux only: add homebrew to your shell 

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
